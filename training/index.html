                <h3>OBEDIENCE TRAINING</h3>
            <p>Training has to be a game for you and your dog, where you can strengthen your bond while you both enjoy your time together, and always using positive reinforcement.<br>
            I can guide you to start the training if you are a beginner, but I can also support you to retrain an adult dog and recover any lost training.</p>
            <p class="smaller">*Obedience training includes: focus, sitting, lying and waiting (which are the basic and most important) and also bringing things, giving paw, enrichment games, rolling over, and lots more. Every animal is different and there will be things they don´t like to do.</p>
            <p class="smaller">*Initial Assessment (I will visit you and we will discuss what you and your dog need and how you can start working on it) - 60min - £50</p>
            <p class="smaller">*1-2-1 classes with you and your dog in your own house to guide and help you train your dog and also give advice with the follow ups (you can do these classes for as long as you think is necessary but you need to keep working with your dog to keep it up) - 30min - £25</p>
        </li>
            <li class="bullet">
                <h3>BEHAVIOURAL TRAINING</h3>
            <p>Some dogs develop behavioural problems, some are related with health problems and others are psychological. I can work with you to try and help some of these problems.<br>
            This type of training is difficult and can be very slow and it needs to be constant and lots of patience from everyone around the animal.</p>
            <p class="smaller">*Behavioural problems can include: bad toilet habits, separation anxiety, not coming when called, pulling on the lead, jumping up and lots of others. </p>
            <p class="smaller">*Initial Assessment (I will visit you and we will discuss and analyse the problem and we will discuss what your dog needs and how we can start working on it) - 90min - £100</p>
            <p class="smaller">*Follow up, I will visit you to check how everything is going, give further advice and set up new goals (between follow ups you will be able to contact me as much as you need for advice while working on the problem) - 60min - £40</p>
            <p class="smaller">*If the problem is beyond my knowledge the visit will be free and I will help you find someone that could help you with it.</p>

            <h3>PUPPY TRAINING</h3>
        <p>Mixed between obedience and behavioural training but for doggies between 3 and 12 months old. Focus on toilet training, walking on a lead, coming on call, being left alone, etc.</p>
        <p class="smaller">*Initial Assessment (I will visit you and your puppy and we will make a plan of action for the training, giving you advice in every step to create a great bond) - 90min - £60</p>
        <p class="smaller">*Follow ups to check how is everything going, give further advice and set up new goals. I will also be available on my phone for any doubts between follow ups - 60min - £30</p>
        <p class="smaller">*1-2-1 classes with your puppy. If you want my help to start the training of your new doggy, I will teach you the basis of training, the steps to follow, the signs of your dog, and everything done in your own house for as many sessions as you want - 30min - £25</p>

            <h3>REPTILE & SMALL MAMMAL TRAINING</h3>

        <p>I can help you with the handling and training of small and big birds. Training them to be comfortable when handled can be very helpful for veterinary reasons, so they don´t stress.
